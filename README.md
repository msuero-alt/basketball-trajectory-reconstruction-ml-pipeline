🏀 TTD: Basketball Shot Tracking & Trajectory Reconstruction

A computer vision system that tracks a basketball in real-time video and reconstructs its flight path using motion modeling and physics-based curve fitting.

The system combines YOLO object detection, temporal tracking, and parabolic trajectory fitting to estimate shot arcs from raw gameplay footage.

*What This Project Does*

This project takes in a basketball video and:

Detects the basketball frame-by-frame using a YOLOv8 model

Tracks the ball’s position over time

Handles missed detections using short-term motion prediction

Reconstructs the shot trajectory

Fits a physics-inspired curve to estimate motion behavior

Outputs a full shot summary + visual trajectory plot

---
*Why I Built This*

Basketball shot analysis in real environments is messy — the ball gets occluded, motion blur happens, and detections are inconsistent.

I wanted to build a lightweight system that could still reconstruct a meaningful trajectory from imperfect data, similar to what you’d see in real sports analytics pipelines.

---
*How It Works*
1. Object Detection

Uses a pretrained YOLOv8 model to detect the basketball in each frame.

2. Tracking Logic

A custom tracking system:

locks onto the first strong detection

filters unstable detections using distance constraints

smooths movement using exponential averaging

3. Occlusion Handling

When the ball disappears:

short gaps are filled using velocity-based prediction

tracking resets if confidence is lost for too long

4. Trajectory Reconstruction

Once coordinates are collected: a quadratic fit is applied to model motion

estimated curve represents shot arc behavior

*What I Learned*

How object detection behaves in noisy real-world environments

Why tracking systems fail (occlusion, duplicate detections, drift)

How to stabilize motion using simple filtering instead of heavy frameworks

How physics-based modeling can still emerge from imperfect data

---
*Real-World Constraints*

This system is designed for real gameplay footage, where:

occlusion occurs frequently

motion blur affects detection stability

camera angles are not perfectly aligned

tracking must tolerate missing frames

Rather than assuming clean lab conditions, the pipeline is built to extract usable signal from imperfect data.

---
*Future Improvements*

3D trajectory reconstruction (depth estimation)

Multi-angle shot fusion

Real-time overlay visualization on video

Player-aware filtering (remove false positives from hands/body)

---
*Summary*

This project explores how far you can get with a simple but carefully designed pipeline for sports tracking:

detection → tracking → prediction → physics modeling

Even with imperfect inputs, the system reconstructs meaningful shot trajectories from real gameplay footage.
